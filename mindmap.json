Brain, as I understand it not any correlation to intelligence, but there are certain areas of the autistic brain that more resemble. Man's brain before modernization. I guess that's the best way that I can explain. My understanding is that the regions of the brain including things like cortex? That may be a different size in an autistic brain and may compare more favorably to a brain earlier in the development of homo sapien. Is there any accuracy to that?",
